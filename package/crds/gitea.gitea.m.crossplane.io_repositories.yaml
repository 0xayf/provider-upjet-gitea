          manages a gitea repository. Per default this repository will be initializiled
          with the provided configuration (gitignore, License etc.). If the username
          property is set to a organisation name, the provider will try to look if
          this organisation exists and create the repository under the organisation
          scope. Repository migrations have some properties that are not available
          to regular repositories. These are all prefixed with migration_.
